// 
// *** WARNING ***
// 
// The software doesn't track the schematic.
// 
// This is version 1.0 of the software, which works with version 1.0 of the power
//   driver board.
// 
// While doing the schematic and board layout, I made some minor changes with the 
//   intention of updating the software once the PCBs came in. The schematic is
//   therefore version 1.2.
// 
// I then discovered that the existing system has problems, and a new circuit V2.0 is
//   being built, which will require V2.0 of the software.
// 
// So this software is V1.0, while the schematic is V1.2, and both are obsolete.
//
// If you want to make the V1.2 board and use this software, contact me for details,
//   you'll need some minor changes.
